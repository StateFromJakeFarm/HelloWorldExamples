# Hello World

* main.cpp illustrates a very simple **C++** console application that displays the message "Hello, World" and then terminates.
* bestLanguageEver.tcl not only sets the standard for **TCL** (Tool Command Language) programming style, but also prints out "Hello World!" to stdout and then terminates.
